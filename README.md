# odin-recipes
HTML Project
This project is created to test and demonstrate my html skills.
I plan to use various things I learnt in The Odin Project as a way to test what I have learnt.
It contains three recipes from www.allrecipes.com including lasagna, Chicken Spaghetti and Indian Chicken Tikka Masala.
